Houseed is a translation layer between a Houdini scene and an appleseed project file. In Houdini slang, houseed is a soho script.


Bugs: plenty!
- Basic support for lights.
- osl menus are not translated properly.
- Probably a lot of missing appleseed parameters on the render node.
- Porbably a lot of missing parameters for camera and geometry.
- Osl coshadares don't work.
- Velocity blur is not working.
- All geometry in the scene is exported. Non polygon objects will not be translated
  correctly. appleseed can only read the obj wavefront format at the moment.


Installing houseed:
- Rename the houdini/python2.xlibs and houdini/soho/puthon2.x directories to the
  python version houdini uses on your system. This will either be python2.6 for
  Houdini12.x or python2.7 for houdini13.
- Copy the directory houdini to the directory where Houdini is installed ($HFS)
- Unfortunately to get a good integration you need to edit some files in the
  houdini directory:

    * Add the following line to $HH/Renderers:

    // AppleSeed
    "AppleSeed 1.0"                 "appleseed"     "appleseed"

    * Add the following line at the end of the theRendererKeywords dictionary in
    $HH/pythgon2.xlibs/defaulttools.py:

    "osl" : "appleseed"

    Make sure there is a , at the line above the one just added.

    * Add the following line to $HH/soho/parameters/SOHOparameters after the line
     reading: #include "MImi3.6.ds"

    // appleseed
    #include "appleseed.ds"

    appleseed.ds holds some appleseed specific user parameters (for now only bokeh
    for the camera and lightsamples for geometry).

- Copy the otl/AppleseedROP.otl to some directory Houdini uses to read digital assets
  from.
- To use openshadinglanguage shaders copy the osl2otl.py script in bin to $HFS/bin.
  Two required libraries are in the houdini/python2.xlibs directory.
- Install the AppleseedROP digital asset.
- In houdini go to Edit -> preferences -> rendering and tick on appleseed. Unfortunatly
  you porobably have to do this every time you start houdini. Appleseed will render with-
  out setting this but adding shaders or parameters to objects and cameras will probably
  not work.


Thanks to:
Jon for helping out with the license and the beta testing.
Francois for making appleseed.
